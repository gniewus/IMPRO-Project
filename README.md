# IMPRO-Project
Spark, Java, Simba, Spatial Queries

## Roadmap
1. We want to use Simba to support development of applications in the mobility domain (Use case already presented) use KNN or other queries to produce output to show in Tableau
		
		a. incorporate Simba as library to spark project
		b. Run queries [IN KNN, IN Range, DISTANCE JOIN, KNN ] using SIMBA
		c. show the result in Tableu 

2. In What amount of data we will analyze (MB to GB)

3. What platform & configuration we have used (i.e, Cloud, standalone cluster)

4. Optimization Implementation: 
								a. Run queries both in Spark SQL and SIMBA, show the differences in terms of execution time in graphs
								
5. possibility: to store time domain we can store data into another database like .....
